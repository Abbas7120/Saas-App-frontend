exports.generateBio = async (req, res) => {
  const { fullName, targetRole, keySkills, experience, careerGoals, tone } = req.body

  const prompt = `You are a professional LinkedIn profile writer. Write a LinkedIn About section for this person.

Name: ${fullName}
Target Role: ${targetRole}
Key Skills: ${keySkills}
Experience: ${experience}
Career Goals: ${careerGoals}
Tone: ${tone}

Rules you MUST follow:
- Output ONLY the bio text — no preamble, no "Here's your bio", no "Sure!", no labels, no commentary
- Start directly with the first sentence of the bio
- 3–5 sentences, punchy and human-sounding
- Do not wrap in quotes or markdown

Now write the bio:
`

  let bio = ""

  try {
    console.log("[Bio] Trying Mistral...")
    bio = await generateWithMistral(prompt)
  } catch (mistralErr) {
    console.warn("[Bio] Mistral failed:", mistralErr.message, "— switching to Gemini")
    bio = await generateWithGemini(prompt)
  }

  res.json({ bio: bio.trim() })
}
